# 21 MERN Book Search

## Description
To complete this challenge for U of MN Full Stack bootcamp, I had to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Pollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. All tasks accomplished,including:

* Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

* Modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

* Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

* Deploy the application to Heroku.

## Installation
To install, download the zip or do a git clone, then in the root directory in terminal type ```npm install```, then ```npm run develop``` to start the server. It should open the web browser and allow you to log in and save books.

## Usage
See install instructions. ```npm run develop```
## Live deployment
Here is the live app on Heroku that you can use: [https://polar-atoll-87978.herokuapp.com/](https://polar-atoll-87978.herokuapp.com/)



## Features
* Users can sign up and log in
* Users can search for books and save them to their own list
* Users can see their saved books, and delete them from the list
* RESTful api is replaced with GraphQL to fetch and modify data
